a) You are expressly prohibited from making or trying to make money from the code, derivatives of the code, compiled portions of the code, etc etc.

b) This license specifically prohibits you from using AdF.ly or AdF.ly clones (any "click past an ad before you can download" service) to make money or attempt to make money for clicks or downloads.

c) Specific exceptions to the non-commercial nature of this license are granted to any derivative works of art. Here's some specific exemptions:

5) Reserved Rights

I reserve the right to change this license at any time, although chances are I won't, because legalese annoys me.
